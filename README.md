# The-Inator

### Ideas
- Automated turret
  - Using a camera to detect a face, if the face is on the left rotate left etc
  - 2 motors for x and y axis
  - Nerf gun strapped on the end of the gimbal and will have a servo to pull the trigger
- Phone unplugger
  - User will plug their phone in and set a timer for charge duration
  - when duration is up the machine will unplug the charging cable
  - optionally: mobile app to broadcast battery level to pi so the user can set what battery level they want it to be un-plugged
